# Initial Question Brainstorm

* Main Questions: Can we gather sentencing data and understand the effects on recidivism and other outcomes?
* Are we specifically focusing on LA City/County?
* Can we make this data openly available?
* Can we see what judges make what decisions?

* What do we need to research?

* Can we compile a list of justice data sets?

* Where does criminal sentencing data live?
* Who owns it?
* Is it published anywhere?
* How do we get it? OR
* How do we request it?

* Is there a secondary source or datapoint that gives same info?

* How is a sentence adminstered? How do you know when to let someoneout of prison?

* Lawyer's viewpoint on this data
* Law enforcement point of view on this data
* Parol Officers point of view on this data
* Judge point of view on this data

* Where do sentencing guidelines live?

* Academic journals?

* What nonprofits?
* What journals?
* What websites?
* What journalists?

* Do judges 'own' specific courthouses/departments? E.g. can we tie a judge to a courthouse? 

* Is it possible to get historic information from LA Superior Court? 
* Calendar search only lets us look up cases that are on-going, and from today's date to 3 months into the future. 

* Is there a way to find sentencing data for specific judges? i.e. when they're coming up for re-election?

* Is California still using an algorithm or program for sentences and bail amounts? **Yes, called Compas -- See /resources/links for more info**
