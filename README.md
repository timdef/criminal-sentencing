# The LA Criminal Sentencing Project

The goal of this project is to gather and make public data about criminal sentences in Los Angeles County.

At this point the project is still in an early research phase. However, we have validated that data around sentencing is not easily available. In this repository you can find resources that we have found helpful during our research.
