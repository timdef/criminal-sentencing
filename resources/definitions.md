# Definitions

**County Jail:** The main difference between jail and prison is based on duration of the term. Jails are short-term holding facilities for the newly arrested and those awaiting trial or sentencing (e.g. currently making appearances in court and were unable to make bail). Local facilities under the jurisdiction of a city, local district, or county. Those sentenced to serve a small amount of time (< 1 year) may be housed in the local jail for the duration of the sentence. County jails also offer and manage alternatives to jail such as work release programs, work furlough, house arrest, and private county jails where the person convicted can serve their sentences on weekends. 

**Private County Jail / City Jail / Pay-to-Stay:** Terms are interchangeable. Privately operated prisons usually run by a corporation, that the state contracts with to house prisoners. Typically houses those who have other obligations like work, children, medical that cannot be put on hold. Typically has a more relaxed environment, cleaner, and allows for private rooms. You can also bring books and a laptop. You are also allowed to split your time and go home on weekdays. 

**State Prison:** Institutional facilities under the jurisdiction of the state where convicted offenders serve longer sentences for more serious crimes. People who have been found guilty of breaking a state law are usually sent to a state prison. 
Example: a person who has been charged with murder will be taken into custody and housed in County Jail. He attends a bail hearing and no bail is set, which means he will have to remain in custody because he is either a flight risk, or a harm to society, or both. During the course of his trial he remains in County Jail. He is later convicted and sentenced to 25 years to life in Prison. Then he will be transferred to State Prison to serve his penalty.

**Federal Prison:** Those who have violated federal laws are typically sent to federal prison located somewhere in the U.S.
